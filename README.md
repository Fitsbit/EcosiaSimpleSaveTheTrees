# EcosiaSimpleSaveTheTrees
Two simple python scripts that search random numbers on Ecosia to help save and plant trees. One script uses Pyautogui while the other does not and uses keyboard. I recommend running them at night when you go to bed 

How to run:

open a notepad file and paste the script of your chose, do ctrl s, and change text file to all files. Name you script as Name.py. Change "name" to some thing of your choice or keep it. 

Open CMD as adminstrator and run commands "pip install pyautogui" and "pip install keyboard" and "pip install mouse". 

You can also download the scripts

Find out what your default browser is, for most windows computers it is Edge or Chrome. open your default browser and open one new empty tab. This allows for the window to stop closing and reopening. If you want to leave it to be and close and reopen skip this step.

Open your file explorer and double click on the script (if that doesn't work open cmd and copy the path of the folder on where you downloaded it. IT can be found at the top. EX: C:\\Users\blank\EcosiaSimpleSaveTheTrees). And boom, your planting trees. Keep in mind that 45 searches allows for one tree planted.
